"""Scalable whole-circuit equivalence verification for Toffoli-network rewrites.

:mod:`equivalence_verifier` gives an EXACT correctness gate, but both of its paths
are O(2^n) in circuit width:

* the classical truth-table path enumerates 2^n basis inputs, and
* the dense-unitary path materialises a 2^n x 2^n matrix.

That is fine for the small windows the selector substitutes into, and for whole
circuits up to ~8-12 qubits, but it cannot certify a WHOLE 16-24 qubit adder /
multiplier / oracle. This module adds a SCALABLE fallback that decides whole-circuit
equivalence without ever building a 2^n object, by dispatching to a decision-diagram
equivalence-checking backend (MQT QCEC), with PyZX as a secondary option.

WHAT IS (AND IS NOT) CHECKED -- READ THIS.
=========================================
There are THREE distinct soundness regimes for a rewrite, and this module keeps them
strictly separate (the selector, :mod:`decomposition_selector`, decides which one a
given rewrite falls into):

  1. EXHAUSTIVELY VERIFIED.  Small enough that ``ExactEquivalenceVerifier.verify``
     runs (truth table or dense unitary). This is the strongest, ground-truth check.
     We always prefer it when it fits.

  2. QCEC-VERIFIED UNITARY (the new scalable path).  For circuits too wide for (1)
     whose rewrite is a PLAIN UNITARY-EQUIVALENT substitution -- i.e. the EXACT
     Clifford+T Toffoli lowering and any count-reduction that preserves the unitary.
     QCEC decides unitary equivalence UP TO GLOBAL PHASE using decision diagrams /
     the ZX-calculus; it never builds the full matrix, so it scales to widths where
     (1) is hopeless. ``equivalent`` and ``equivalent_up_to_global_phase`` both count
     as equivalent here (a global phase is physically unobservable).

  3. ANALYSIS-SOUND PHASE-AWARE.  The phase-aware (relative-phase / Margolus)
     substitutions are *deliberately NOT* plain unitary-equivalent to the exact
     decomposition -- they differ by a RELATIVE phase. So they FAIL QCEC by
     construction (QCEC will report ``not_equivalent``), and feeding them to this
     module's unitary path would be a category error. Their soundness at scale does
     NOT come from QCEC. It comes from the static analysis:

         * :func:`phase_observability.is_phase_unobservable` proves the relative
           phase can never reach a measurement, AND
         * the SOUND reachable over-approximation
           (:func:`reachable_subspace.reachable_overapprox`) restricts the inputs the
           phase-insensitive agreement must hold on.

     Where the over-approximation is used the criterion can only OVER-REJECT (it is
     sound, not complete): it may refuse a valid substitution, but it can never admit
     an invalid one. This is an ANALYSIS guarantee, not a machine-checked
     whole-circuit equivalence, and we label it as such -- never as "verified".

:func:`verify_scalable` covers regimes (1) and (2): it dispatches exhaustive for
small width and QCEC (or PyZX) for large, for substitutions where plain unitary
equivalence is the right notion. For regime (3) it refuses to pretend: it returns a
result tagged ``method="qcec"`` reporting ``not_equivalent`` if you (wrongly) hand it
a phase-aware rewrite, and the caller is expected to certify those via the analysis
instead (see :func:`decomposition_selector.ErrorBudgetSelector.select`).

        phase), ``"pyzx"`` (ZX-calculus), or ``"none"`` (no backend available).
    up_to_global_phase : bool
        For the QCEC/PyZX path: whether equivalence holds only up to a global phase
        (which is physically unobservable). Always considered equivalent.
    n_qubits : int

    --------
    * width(rewritten) <= ``exhaustive_max_qubits`` -> EXHAUSTIVE
      (:meth:`ExactEquivalenceVerifier.verify`: truth table for classical-reversible
      circuits, dense unitary otherwise). Ground truth.

    Parameters
    ----------
    original, rewritten : QuantumCircuit
        ``rewritten`` may have >= original.num_qubits; the extra (highest-index)
        qubits are clean ancilla (|0> in, |0> out). QCEC accepts mismatched widths and
        treats the extra qubits as ancilla.
    exhaustive_max_qubits : int
        Width at/below which we run the exhaustive ground-truth check. The crossover.
    allow_permutation : bool
        Only honoured on the exhaustive path (QCEC checks fixed wiring up to global
        phase). If True and the rewrite needs an output-wire permutation, only the
        exhaustive path can certify it.
    prefer : {"auto", "exhaustive", "qcec", "pyzx"}
        Force a backend. ``"auto"`` uses the width dispatch above. ``"exhaustive"``
        forces the exact check regardless of width (may be infeasible -- caller's
        risk). ``"qcec"`` / ``"pyzx"`` force the scalable backend even for small
        circuits (useful to benchmark the crossover).
