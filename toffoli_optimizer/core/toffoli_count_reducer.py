"""Toffoli-COUNT reduction (multi-controlled gates kept ATOMIC).

This is the capability the original toptoffoli pipeline lacks. toptoffoli reduces
*depth* by decomposing each Toffoli into a fixed CX+1q gadget -- the number of
multi-controlled (CCX/MCX/CCZ) operations it emits is therefore at least the
number it started with. Here we go the other way: we treat every CCX / CCZ / MCX
as an ATOMIC, indivisible, expensive primitive and try to reduce HOW MANY of them
the circuit contains, never decomposing one into CX + 1q gates.

Every rewrite is checked with the committed `ExactEquivalenceVerifier` over the
local window it touches BEFORE it is applied; a rewrite that does not verify
equivalent is rejected and the circuit is left unchanged. Rewrites are iterated
to a fixpoint.

Implemented count-reducing rewrites
-----------------------------------
* INVERSE-PAIR ANNIHILATION
  Two multi-controlled gates with identical (control-set, target) and nothing
  touching any of their qubits in between are self-inverse and cancel; both are
  removed. Commutation through qubit-disjoint gates is used to bring a pair
  adjacent so the cancellation is exposed.

* EQUAL-CONTROL FAN-OUT / CSE (compute-once fan-out)
  A run of CCX gates that share the SAME (unordered) control pair but hit
  different targets -- CCX(a,b,t1), CCX(a,b,t2), ... -- recomputes the boolean
  ``a & b`` once per target. With one clean ancilla we can compute ``a & b`` into
  the ancilla a single time (1 CCX), fan it out with cheap CX gates to every
  target, and uncompute (1 CCX). That turns ``k`` Toffolis into ``2`` Toffolis
  (plus k CX). It is applied only when it strictly lowers the atomic count AND
  verifies equivalent.

* WINDOWED CROSS-BOUNDARY ANNIHILATION
  A small windowed search that commutes a multi-controlled gate past Clifford /
  disjoint gates inside a bounded window to expose cancellations a strictly
  greedy adjacency pass misses. Each candidate is verified before applying.

* EXPAND-TO-CANCEL PEEPHOLE (superoptimizer idea)
  A bounded-window pass that does NOT insist every intermediate rewrite shrink the
  block. It enumerates a small set of equivalence-preserving EXPANSIONS of a
  window (e.g. the fan-out conjugation identity
  ``CCX(a,b,t); CX(t,u); CCX(a,b,t) == CX(t,u); CCX(a,b,u)`` which pushes the
  controlled action onto the moved target, eliminating one CCX), simplifies the
  result with the existing annihilation machinery, and keeps it ONLY if the net
  atomic Toffoli count STRICTLY drops AND the window verifies equivalent. A strict
  adjacency/commute walk misses these because the useful intermediate is not
  smaller gate-by-gate.

* PERMUTATION-AWARE REWRITING (opt-in)
  Output-wire relabeling is free for a downstream consumer, so a count-reducing
  rewrite that verifies only up to a NON-identity output-wire permutation is still
  usable -- PROVIDED the permutation is tracked. With ``allow_permutation=True``
  such a rewrite is applied AND the implied wire relabeling is propagated to every
  downstream gate, with the local permutation composed into a cumulative
  output-wire permutation exposed in ``report['output_permutation']``. A final
  whole-circuit guard re-verifies (up to that exact cumulative permutation) so the
  returned circuit, read through the reported permutation, computes the SAME
  function as the input.
