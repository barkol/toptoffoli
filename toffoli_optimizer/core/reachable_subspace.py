"""Reachable computational-basis subspace at a gate in a Toffoli network.

A relative-phase (Margolus) Toffoli computes the SAME Boolean function as an exact
CCX but stamps a relative phase on the |11> control branch. Whether substituting it
is sound depends on (a) which inputs actually *reach* the gate, and (b) whether the
resulting phase is ever *observable*. This module answers (a): it computes, or
soundly over-approximates, the set of computational-basis states that can appear at
a given gate, given an input space.

WHY A BASIS-STATE SET SUFFICES (and is exact for classical-reversible prefixes).
If every gate BEFORE ``gate_index`` is classical-reversible (x / cx / ccx / mcx /
swap), then the prefix is a permutation ``pi`` of the 2^n computational basis. Any
computational-basis input ``x`` maps to the single basis state ``pi(x)`` at the
gate -- no superposition is created. So the *reachable set* at the gate is exactly
``{ pi(x) : x in input_space }``, a finite set of basis indices. Enumerating it is
the exact reachable subspace (restricted to the basis), and admissibility checks
that range over this set are over the true reachable inputs.

If the prefix contains a superposition-creating gate (h / ry / t / ...), a single
basis input can spread over many basis states. We then fall back to a SOUND
OVER-APPROXIMATION: the set of basis states whose amplitude *could* be nonzero is a
superset of the truly-reachable basis states. Checking an admissibility predicate
on a SUPERSET is sound for accepting a rewrite: if the predicate holds for every
state in the superset, it holds for every truly-reachable state a fortiori. (It can
only make us reject -- never wrongly accept -- a substitution.)

Two entry points:

* ``reachable_basis_states(circuit, gate_index, input_space='all_basis')`` -- EXACT
  enumeration for a classical-reversible prefix. Returns a ``frozenset`` of basis
  indices (little-endian: qubit j == bit j). Raises if the prefix is not classical-
  reversible or if the enumeration would be too large (caller should fall back to
  the over-approximation).

* ``reachable_overapprox(circuit, gate_index, ...)`` -- a cheap SOUND superset that
  always succeeds. See its docstring for the soundness argument.

    Returns a SUPERSET of the truly reachable computational-basis states. Useful when

    large.

    SOUNDNESS OF OVER-APPROXIMATION.  Admissibility of a substitution is a predicate
    we require to hold for *every reachable input*. If ``R`` is the true reachable set
    and ``S ⊇ R`` is our over-approximation, then

        ( predicate holds for all s in S )  =>  ( predicate holds for all r in R ).

    So verifying on the superset can only cause us to *reject* a valid substitution
    (when some unreachable s in S \\ R fails) -- never to *accept* an invalid one.
    Hence any superset is sound for admissibility. We return the SMALLEST cheap
    superset we can justify:

    * If the prefix up to ``gate_index`` is classical-reversible, delegate to the
      exact ``reachable_basis_states`` (the exact set is its own tightest superset).
    * Otherwise, identify the qubits that the prefix could have driven into a
      non-classical (superposition) state -- the ``tainted`` qubits: any qubit
      touched by a non-classical gate, plus any qubit later entangled with one via a
      classical gate (a CX from a tainted control taints its target; a tainted qubit
      participating in any multi-qubit gate taints all of that gate's qubits). On the
      classical ("clean") qubits we still know the exact bit value reachable from the
      input space; on the tainted qubits we conservatively allow BOTH 0 and 1. The
      returned superset is { clean-bits fixed } x { all 2^t assignments of tainted
      bits }. This is a sound superset because the true state's clean bits match
      (those gates were classical and deterministic) and its tainted bits are among
      all assignments by definition.
