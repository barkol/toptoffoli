"""Context analysis: where is a relative-phase Toffoli decomposition *admissible*?

The cheap relative-phase (Margolus) Toffoli implements CCX(a,b,t) correctly only
UP TO A RELATIVE PHASE on the target subspace: it flips ``t`` exactly when
``a & b``, like a real Toffoli, but it also stamps a state-dependent phase. That
phase is harmless precisely when it is later *uncomputed* -- i.e. when the gate is
one half of a compute/uncompute pair whose two relative phases cancel.

The canonical safe pattern is

    CCX(a, b, t)              # compute:  t ^= a&b   (+ relative phase phi)
    ... gates that use t only as a CONTROL, never re-touching a or b's logical
        roles in a way that breaks the pairing ...
    CCX(a, b, t)              # uncompute: t ^= a&b   (- relative phase phi)

If between the two matched gates the target ``t`` is only ever read (used as a
control) and never written (never a target, never permuted by a swap), and the
controls ``a, b`` are not disturbed, then replacing BOTH Toffolis by the
relative-phase gadget leaves the overall unitary unchanged on the data subspace:
the relative phase of the compute is exactly undone by the uncompute.

This module finds candidate sites of that form. It is deliberately CONSERVATIVE:
it only reports a (compute_idx, uncompute_idx, qubits) site that *looks* safe by
this structural rule. The decomposition selector then VERIFIES each reported site
exactly (via ExactEquivalenceVerifier) before committing the substitution, so a
false positive here can never produce an incorrect circuit -- it is merely
rejected downstream.
