# Safety experiment: verified vs. count-greedy relative-phase substitution

Count-greedy / pattern-matched relative-phase (Margolus / RCCX) Toffoli substitution -- the kind a template optimizer performs when it trusts its rewrite library -- is applied two ways over the benchmark suite:

* **naive**: replace every CCX with a relative-phase Toffoli, no checking.
* **gated**: same per-gate substitution, kept only if a per-window exact verification (toptoffoli `ExactEquivalenceVerifier`) proves the circuit still computes the original function.

## Aggregate (headline)

**Naive substitution silently corrupts 6 of 12 circuits; the verification gate yields 0 errors while still applying 22 valid relative-phase decompositions.**


Every naive failure is a circuit that the count-greedy optimizer would have shipped while computing the WRONG function -- detected here only because we ran an exact equivalence check after the fact. The gated pass keeps exactly the relative-phase decompositions that are provably valid (the compute/uncompute ones) and falls back to exact Toffolis everywhere else, so it is sound by construction.


## Real-world instance
This complements the audit of toptoffoli's own pattern library, which flagged **66 non-equivalent relative-phase rewrites** in the shipped rule set -- the same failure mode, occurring in production rules rather than a synthetic benchmark.
