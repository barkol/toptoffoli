"""Tests for reachable-subspace + phase-observability-aware admissibility.

This is the soundness suite for the NEW admissibility path: a standalone Toffoli
(not in a compute/uncompute pair) may get the cheap relative-phase (Margolus) gadget
when its relative phase is provably UNOBSERVABLE on the states that reach it. Every
committed substitution must produce identical computational-basis MEASUREMENT
STATISTICS on every reachable input.

Run with:  python test_reachable_subspace.py

Covers:
  A. PHASE PROVABLY UNOBSERVABLE, NOT A PAIR. A Toffoli whose forward cone is a pure
     classical-reversible cone into a computational-basis read. The NEW path admits
     the relative-phase substitution; the OLD pair-only path does NOT; the output is
     sound (same measurement statistics on ALL reachable inputs); 2q-count drops.

  B. SOUNDNESS GUARD: downstream Hadamard makes the phase observable. is_phase_
     unobservable returns False -> the substitution is REJECTED -> output stays exact
     and sound. We also verify the rejected substitution WOULD have been observably
     wrong (different measurement statistics), proving the guard is load-bearing.

  C. Regression: the existing compute/uncompute-pair admissions still work and every
     output is verified sound (delegated to the existing suite + a spot check here).

  D. Unit tests for reachable_basis_states / reachable_overapprox soundness and for
     is_phase_unobservable's classical-cone vs interference distinction.
